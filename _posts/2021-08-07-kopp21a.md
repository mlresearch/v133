title: Traffic4cast at NeurIPS 2020 - yet more on the unreasonable effectiveness of
  gridded geo-spatial processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2020 Competition and Demonstration Track

abstract: The IARAI Traffic4cast competition at NeurIPS 2019 showed that neural networks
  can successfully predict future traffic conditions 15 minutes into the future on
  simply aggregated GPS probe data  in time and space bins, thus interpreting the
  challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-nets proved
  to be the winning architecture then, demonstrating an ability  to extract relevant
  features in the complex, real-world, geo-spatial process that is traffic derived
  from a large data set. The IARAI Traffic4cast challenge at NeurIPS 2020 build on
  the insights of the previous year and sought to both challenge some assumptions
  inherent in our 2019 competition design and explore how far this neural network
  technique can be pushed. We found that the  prediction horizon can be extended successfully
  to 60 minutes into the future, that there is further evidence that traffic depends
  more on recent dynamics than on the additional static or dynamic location specific
  data provided and that a reasonable starting point when exploring a general aggregated
  geo-spatial process in time and space is a U-net architecture.
