abstract: Deep learning has been recently successfully applied to an ever larger number
  of problems, ranging from pattern recognition to complex decision making. However,
  several concerns have been raised, including guarantees of good generalization,
  which is of foremost importance. Despite numerous attempts, conventional statistical
  learning approaches fall short of providing a satisfactory explanation on why deep
  learning works. In a competition hosted at the Thirty-Fourth Conference on Neural
  Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), we invited the community to design
  robust and general complexity measures that can accurately predict the generalization
  of models. In this paper, we describe the competition design, the protocols, and
  the solutions of the top-three teams at the competition in details. In addition,
  we discuss the outcomes, common failure modes, and potential future directions for
  the competition.
