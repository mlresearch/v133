  NeurIPS 2020 Procgen Benchmark'

abstract: The NeurIPS 2020 Procgen Competition was designed as a centralized benchmark
  with clearly defined tasks for measuring Sample Efficiency and Generalization in
  Reinforcement Learning. Generalization remains one of the most fundamental challenges
  in deep reinforcement learning, and yet we do not have enough benchmarks to measure
  the progress of the community on Generalization in Reinforcement Learning. We present
  the design of a centralized benchmark for Reinforcement Learning which can help
  measure Sample Efficiency and Generalization in Reinforcement Learning by doing
  end to end evaluation of the training and rollout phases of thousands of user submitted
  code bases in a scalable way. We designed the benchmark on top of the already existing
  Procgen Benchmark by defining clear tasks and standardizing the end to end evaluation
  setups. The design aims to maximize the flexibility available for researchers who
  wish to design future iterations of such benchmarks, and yet imposes necessary practical
  constraints to allow for a system like this to scale. This paper presents the competition
  setup and the details and analysis of the top solutions identified through this
  setup in context of 2020 iteration of the competition at NeurIPS.
